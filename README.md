## About

A GraphQL API built with Go and MongoDB for portfolio projects and notes. The API is consumed by the frontend to render portfolio content dynamically. This project is no longer running in production — the data is now served directly on the frontend.

Access the old production endpoint (read-only) at: [https://api.andr3w.sh](https://api.andr3w.sh)

## Features

* GraphQL queries for projects and notes
* Data mutations restricted for security (CORS and no public access)
* Dockerized for local development and deployment
* Automatic data updates on the frontend via SSR, no rebuilds required

## Tech stack

* Go with [gqlgen](https://gqlgen.com) — GraphQL server
* MongoDB — Database
* Docker Compose — Container orchestration
* Nginx — Reverse proxy and SSL termination
* Certbot — HTTPS via Let’s Encrypt
* Terraform — AWS EC2 infrastructure management

## Quick start

```bash
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/andrewjamesmoore/andrew-projects-api.git
